# EXPERIMENT 1 - Introduction to Python Programming
This repository contains my solutions for the first experiment in ECE 2112: Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms. I've used Jupyter Notebook to implement and test my Python code. The code will prompt user for the input values.

## Problem 1: ALPHABET SOUP
Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.

## Problem 2: EMOTICON
Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad and mad with their corresponding emoticon:
| word | emoticon |
| --- | --- |
| smile | :) |
| grin | :D |
| sad | :(( |
| mad | >:( |

## Problem 3: UNPACKING LIST
Unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.

## Sample Input and Output
Problem 1
```
Enter a word: hellohacker
aceehhkllor
```

Problem 2
```
Enter a sentence: make me sad
make me :((
```

Problem 3
```
lst = 1 2 3
First: 1 Middle: ['2'] Last: 3
```
